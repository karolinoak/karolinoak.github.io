                I watch about 3 hours of television a week. It's far less than my friends. 
                I think that the most interesting films comes from "Avengers" series.<br>
                I'm usually listening a music from radio and hardly ever reading a newspapers.

        <p>
               I spend about 10 hours a week online. My favourite websites are YouTube.com for watching funny videos and I also often use facebook.com to speak with my firends.
